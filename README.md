# Item Length And Its Indices

## What Does It Do?

Python program to display item length and its indices

## How to use it?

Make sure to have both files in the same directory.

To run execute `item_length_and_its_and_its_indices.py`

The syntax of the line **`isinstance(item, str | list | dict)`** in the **`item_length`** function requires Python 3.10. For version less than 3.10, line needs to be modified like this: **`isinstance(item, (str, list, dict))`**
